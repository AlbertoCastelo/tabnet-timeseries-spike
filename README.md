# Pytorch Project Template

A template to easily bootstrap Pytorch projects accessing GPUs.

## Quick commands

```make shell```: start a command line 

```make jupyter```: start a Jupyter-Lab server 

Both commands will mount a volume on the projects' directory.


## Notebooks

```test-gpu.ipynb```: checks the GPUs are accessible inside the container.
