# Spike with TabNet for Timeseries Data

In this Spike I review the use of [TabNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+arxiv%2FQSXk+%28ExcitingAds%21+cs+updates+on+arXiv.org%29) by Google AI using the Pytorch implementation by [Dreamquark-AI](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet)
on Timeseries data from Flight-Pasanger Dataset

## Quick commands

```make shell```: start a command line 

```make jupyter```: start a Jupyter-Lab server 

Both commands will mount a volume on the projects' directory.


## Notebooks

```tabnet-does-not-learn-interesting-features.ipynb```: Trains/Validate/Test models with different set of features


```test-gpu.ipynb```: checks the GPUs are accessible inside the container.
